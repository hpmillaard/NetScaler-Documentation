# NetScaler-Documentation
NetScaler Documentation Powershell script to Word or PDF.

This is a new version from the script that I found here: https://www.carlwebster.com/downloads/download-info/netscaler/

Many thanks to Carl Webster, Jeff Wouters, Andrew McCullough, Barry Schiffer and Iain Brighton

There are some big changes in this version:
- Parts that are not used or not changed from the defaults are now hidden in the document.
- Added an option to give a $reportname.
- Updated to version 14.1

For more info, just check the file in the #region changelog.

If you have any comments or problems, I'd love to hear them!
